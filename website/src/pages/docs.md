# Docs

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`

## Introduction

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:

- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!

## Code Blocks

```js
import { createRequire } from 'module'
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url)
const fs = require('fs')
```
